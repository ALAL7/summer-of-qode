# Assignment

This file contains all the assignments for this particular class. Students are required to solve each problem with Python and submit the code.

## Class Assignments

* [ ] Define a function which takes in 2 integers and returns the greatest out of the two.
* [ ] Define a function which changes the value of a global variable.
* [ ] Define a function to replace a value in a list (do *not* use ```.replace()```)

## Home Assignments

Write a function which takes in a list of negative numbers and returns the number with the largest absolute value. You will have to research about the built-in abs() function.

* [ ] Write a function which takes a list as a parameter and returns the number of elements in it.
* [ ] Write a function which takes 2 parameters- a list and an element. The function should iterate over the list to check if the second parameter, the element, is in the list. If it is, then return true otherwise return false. Example- if [2,3,4] and 3 are passed then true should be returned, but if [2,3,4] and 6 are passed then false should be returned.
