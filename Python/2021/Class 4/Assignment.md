# Assignment

This file contains all the assignments for this particular class. Students are required to solve each problem with Python and submit the code.

## Class Assignments

* [ ] 1. Input 5 numbers and append to a list. Then, iterate over the list and calculate the sum of all the values in the list. Compare the result with the ```sum()``` function and print the result. The output should be as follows: ```The sum is 10, True```.
* [ ] Using the ```random``` module, create a program to generate a list of 5 random numbers. Print the maximum and minimum value in this list using ```max()``` and ```min()```.
* [ ] **Number Guessing Game:** Generate a random integer in the range 1 - 10. Store this value in a variable ```value```. Input a number from the user and check whether it is the same.

## Home Assignments

* [ ] Add a feature to the number guessing game, where a person gets 3 tries to guess the number.
* [ ] **Rock Paper Scissors:** Create a Python version of the classic game, rock paper scissors. Hint: you can use ```random.choice``` (Google it to see what it does!)
* [ ] Randomly select 5 elements of a list using their index (do *not* use ```random.choice()```). Then, check for duplicate values. *Hint:* ****use the ```.count()``` method.
