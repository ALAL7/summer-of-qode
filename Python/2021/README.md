# Course Project

The aim of the course project is to use all the concepts you have learnt in this course to create a game or solve a real-world problem.

You are free to create a project of your choice, but to get you started, here are a few suggestions:

### Smaller Projects

1. Quiz Game
2. Command Line Calculator

### Larger Projects

1. Download an entire webpage and scan it for keywords. *Hint:* you will need to use the requests module to download the file. Here is some code to download a webpage

```python
import requests

data = requests.get("https://wikipedia.com")
data = data.text
```
