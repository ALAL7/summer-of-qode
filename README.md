## The Task

We were given the challenge to teach middle schoolers the fundamentals of Python in just 5 one-hour sessions. Luckily, we had experience, so we were able to cover a lot of things a beginner would want to learn in Python from creating their first program, to making mini-games on their own. We have created this course to be as interactive as possible with interesting assignments and cool mini-projects for students to make. We hope this repository is useful to not just the kids we taught, but to anyone on the internet who may be interested in getting started with Python! You can contact us if you want any more details: [E-mail](mailto:contact@qprogramming.net)

### How Can I Contribute?
If you took the course and want to add your code to the repository, you can create a ```pull request```. First, ```fork``` the repo, and in your own copy of the repo, upload all the files for each class in the ```Student Codes``` folder. You will need to create a folder with your name first, however. We recommend that you download the GitHub Desktop App and clone the forked repo and then create a pull request online.

You can also contribute to the tutorials. Submit a pull request if you have anything useful!
