#### Creating Your Own Code
We kept the option for students in our live sessions to submit their code to the repository by creating a folder with their name in the ```Student Code``` in each class folder. If you want to add your code to this repository, you can fork this repo and then submit a pull request after you have added your code! We may not accept all submissions, but it doesn't hurt to try! You will find solutions to all problems available in the repo, however.
